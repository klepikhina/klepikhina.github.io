title: Granby Dam, Grand Forks, BC | Crag
---

Sometimes I think I know what I'm doing sport climbing, but then I want to spell "crag" like "craig" and think maybe not.

Very cool crag to stumble upon in "not a guide book". The internet says Granby Dam is a popular swimming hole, to which I would respond - April is too early.

The dam was originally used to supply power to the small rural town of Grand Forks. The dam broke in the mid-1900s and a 5 foot wall of water flooded the town. When the flood happened, the water was up to 8 feet deep.

When you find the sneaky road down to the crag, the approach is a very short and pleasant walk along a double track trail.

We did 5 out of the 6 bolted climbs at the crag - all unnamed. The final one was not completed due to high water levels and not being able to access the belay without being swept down the river.

The climbing grades from left to right are as follows:
- 5.9 - primary pillar - (not climbed)
- 5.9 - primary pillar
- 5.10a - primary pillar
- 5.10a - primary pillar
- 5.9 - primary pillar
- 5.10c - secondary pillar

We were surprised to see a duo power boating down the creek. I can't imagine that the water was more than 5 feet deep. Where are they going? What's their story?
