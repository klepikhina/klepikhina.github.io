title: Ten Sleep, WY | cragging

Climbing trip, best friends, fireworks in Wyoming. Not a bad way to spend the Fourth! Started off weak with both Justin and I having food poisoning and only got better with time. It can really only go uphill from there.

The first area we went to was the Powers Wall. Welcome to the Ten Sleep Zoo! Challenging and busy!

Then we checked out Waterfall Walls - easy and slippery.

Apres climbing was split between the best (and only) burger place in town, 1 Cow, and our campsite in the lot of Ten Sleep Brewing. Unfortunately this year we missed the dancing in town due to feeling unwell. Despite being in a cowboy town, the dancers were serenaded by the local high schoolers playing Green Day covers. I hear it was fantastic.

The following day we went up to Sidewalk Buttress to climb Where the Sidewalk Ends. This route is 160 ft of progressively more challenging climbing - a major highlight of the trip! The cherry on top was the crag-cat we met at the base. Dwayne, I believe.

The top rope for this climb was a bit silly, though.

Though we spent most of our time at the climbing areas, we also checked out some swimming and fishing, and of course, the rodeo! After this trip, I can finally say "It's not my first rodeo."

On the final day, we made a quick stop to climb at Blue Corner on our way out.

On the drive out, we stopped by Ayres Natural Bridge Park. Was concerned about the quantity of wasp nests until we realized they were cliff swallow nests! So cool.
