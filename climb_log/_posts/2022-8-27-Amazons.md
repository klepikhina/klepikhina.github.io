title: Amazons, Castlegar, BC | 5.8 - 8 pitches
---

Adding this post to have some sort of written documentation of the Amazons multipitch in the KeTaMux climbing area in Castlegar, BC. The first three pitches of this climb are on Joan of Arc. All of the pitches are easily simulclimbed or perhaps even soloed for those that like to keep things spicy. While the approach is a bit of an I-spy game, and the climb is a bit dirty, it's an excellent place to teach someone how to multipitch. The bolts are painted matte so route finding can be a bit tricky at times but the wall is incredibly well bolted.

We went up in four parties of two:
- Will and Brian simulclimbed the entire thing and rappelled down to the top of Joan of Arc in about 30 minutes. Brian used about 12 bolts on the entire climb!!
- Jacqueline and Victoria simulclimbed as well.
- Justin and I got some practice multipitching in. We climbed the wall in about 6 pitches but could have done it in fewer if we didn't hit a bit of traffic at the beginning.
- Dan and Lenka multipitched the first 3 pitches then soloed the remaining 5.

The climb is fully bolted.

From the summit, there are rap rings all the way down Amazons to the top of Joan of Arc.

 After rappelling from the top, you walk to the climbers left at the top of Joan of Arc and bushwack down the descent trail. Follow either orange, blue, or yellow tape as far as you can and then just make your way back down to the road any way you can.

When the mountain project description says "discrete flagging" they mean _extremely_ discrete.

Good luck!
