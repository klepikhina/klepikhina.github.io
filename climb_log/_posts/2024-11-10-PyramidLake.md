title: Pig Rock + Contra Canyon, Pyramid Lake, NV | crag - 3 climbs
---

Winter climbing crag near Reno! Everyone knows about Tahoe but do people know about Pyramid Lake? It is only slightly smaller in surface area and is the termination point of the Truckee River (the only outlet from Lake Tahoe).

Pig Rock used to be known as the area's "gym climbing" before there were climbing gyms. The rock is super solid and super sharp. Very tricky climbs on this wall! Justin led the 5.11c (Plant Food) and we re-learned that our weight difference is not that scary and that it's okay if he falls! As long as it's not the first or second bolt... we need to remember the Ohm next time. The other climb we tried on this wall was the 5.12 which was put up by Alex. Alex was lapping it; I had to basically be pulled up the climb. Lots of room for me to grow!

Contra Canyon was the next area we checked out near Pyramid Lake. An off-road vehicle is definitely necessary to get to this one unless you want to walk several miles. This crag was super beautiful and warm in the winter sun, but the rock quality wasn't great! We climbed a 5.9 and 5.8 on this wall. Hope you like pealing rocks!
