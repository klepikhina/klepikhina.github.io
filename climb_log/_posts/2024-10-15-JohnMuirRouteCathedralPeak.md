title: John Muir Route (The Mountaineer's Route) - Cathedral Peak, Yosemite National Park, CA | easy 5th scramble
---

Would love to come back some day and climb the main face of Cathedral! Today we decided to do the scamble on the south face. This route is primarily a hike until the last bit which rapidly transitions from 3rd to 4th to easy 5th class.

The last few hundred feet require some very exposed steps. We chose to not completely summit this time.

Checked out the South East Buttress instead!
