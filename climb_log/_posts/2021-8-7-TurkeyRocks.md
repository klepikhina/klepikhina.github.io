---

Turkey Rocks - "one of the finest concentrations of crack climbing in Colorado". What better place to learn how to crack climb? I had never been crack climbing and couldn't miss the opportunity. I spent the afternoon on Friday trail running with my mom in Winter Park. I had a half marathon in Steamboat on Sunday. Could I squeeze in a trip to Turkey Rocks? Bien sur!

Route climbed:
- Nightime Madness - 5.7 Trad
- Gobble Up - 5.8 Trad
- Steppenwolf - 5.9 Trad
- Stiff, Little Fingers - 5.12a Sport

  We met up with Thomas and he brought his drone! Worth it for the photos.
