title: Junior High, Donner Summit, CA | 5.6 - 3 pitches
---

On a warm spring day, we took a trip up to cannibal-mountain.. I mean... Donner Summit! This is one of the most popular climbing areas in the Lake Tahoe area. We were lucky to be the only ones going up Junior High on School Rock. Junior High is one of the few multi-pitches on the I-80 corridor.

Pitch 1 is a short 5.6 traverse (unless you choose to do the 5.8 direct).

Pitch 2 follows a couple of vertical 5.6 cracks.

Pitch 3 starts as a slab stroll then wanders up a short crack system to the summit.

We caught the swing on the way down to the descent gully!
