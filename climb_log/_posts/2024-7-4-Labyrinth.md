You want a squeeze chimney? This is the best bang for your buck. Was it a 5.6? Maybe - people solo it. Did it feel like one? Boyyyy!

Would highly recommend just for the laughs. I could jsut squeeze in at the main entrance. Justin had to climb higher and chicken wing to get in - definitely the harder variation!

The approach was a bit of a bush wack.

The first pitch cruises up a 5.3.

And then the fun begins.

Poking out at the top brings you to classic Donner Summit views. The second photo shows the right side of Black Wall.

We were rewarded with a gorgeous sunset at Lake Tahoe followed by seeing fireworks across the lake in Incline and in Zephyr Cove and a drone show in Tahoe City.
