title: 2nd Flatiron (Freeway), Boulder, CO | 5.0 - 6 pitch scramble
---

I wanted to compile a few photos from multiple happy jaunts up Freeway. Is there anything more Boulder classic than a casual run up the Second? 

Flatiron photos from each time up in 2021:

This was my first time going up the second flatiron. I was, naturally, quite nervous so I brought climbing shoes and a chalk bag. These remained in my bag the whole time as I went up the rock in trail runners (to each there own). I was lucky to follow two wonderful, close friends - Hannah and Andy. Yeah sure, I'd follow them up anything!

This time, I did a friend scramble with Justin, Owen, and Kelsey. Kelsey regularly went up the Second after work so we let her lead the way. You really can't mess up too badly on the way up, but it's always nice to follow someone that knows where they're going!

Justin and I's friend Maya came to Boulder! We had to show her was Colorado was all about. This was also my first time leading the way. :)

09/14/2021 - I had the opportunity to catch up with my good friend David from high school when he came home to visit! He climbed far too fast while chatting the whole time so I could only snag 1-2 photos.

12/02/2021 - Emi and I climbed the Second for my Canadian send off! So lucky to be able to climb in December.
