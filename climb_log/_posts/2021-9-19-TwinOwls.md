The second photo below was a funny moment! I remember watching Justin stand on the rock and look around for any possible spot to place gear. The move was a realtively easy pull over a roof, however a comfort piece would be nice. Justin places the worlds tiniest piece of gear and makes the move -- the piece delicately pops out. We nervous laugh and keep going.
