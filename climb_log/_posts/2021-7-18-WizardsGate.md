Eric and Justin took me up my second multipitch! They definitely have me hooked. We did two runs up Wizards Gate:

- The White Raven: 5.11a/b - 4 pitches
- Return of the King: 5.8 - 5 pitches

We started by trying to get over to Mainliner. But after completing the approach, we ran into raptor closures so we turned back and made our way up the Twin Sisters Trail and over to Wizards Gate.

The views above 10,000 ft are gorgeous and the rock is so cool.

Eric took the lead up The White Raven; Justin and I followed.
