title: Renata Arch, Central Kootenays, BC | 9.1km, 305m

For some reason when we first moved to the Kootenay's, Renata Arch was one of the first places I desperately wanted to check out. The arch is also known as the Brooklyn Bridge - named after the ghost town of Brooklyn.

In 1898, Brooklyn became the headquarters for the Columbia and Western Railway's westward extension. Steamboats would travel between Brooklyn and Robson (near Castlegar) 4 times a day. Hotels, a hospital, a police station, and shops were all constructed that same year. Less than a year into the foundation of the town, a fire burned down a hotel and the rest of the town followed later that year. In 1909, the former town was included in a subdivision for orchards but was flooded and submerged when the Castlegar/ Robson Keenleyside Dam flooded in 1968.

To get over to the arch, we paddled 2.7km from Deer Park across arrow lake to the beach on the other side.

After pulling the paddle board + the kayak up onto the rocky beach (being careful not to pop the kayak), we walked up the well-signed but overgrown trail 1.9km up to the arch.

And we finally spotted the magnificent impressive arch. Turns out you can actually see it from Deer Park if you know where to look, but it's much more impressive up close.

There's even a nice running spring going under it, and you can hike to the top of the arch.

We spend a lot of time talking about how the arch has the potential to be a very cool climb. ðŸ‘€

Before paddling back, we made sure to take a refreshing dip in the lake. The west side of the lake has a steep drop off - perfect for a quick swim.
