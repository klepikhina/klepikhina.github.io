title: Mount Elbert, CO
---

The highest summit in the Rocky Mountains and the second highest in the contiguous US! It sits right next to Mount Massive which is the second highest summit in Colorado. There's funny story that originally Massive was measured as the highest peak in the Rockies - there is only around a 12 foot difference between the two peaks. People often pick a favorite and hike Massive to add some rocks to the top, then hike Elbert and take some rocks off the top. :)
