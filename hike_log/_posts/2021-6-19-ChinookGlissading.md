When Hannah and Andy told me they were having an engagement party, I gave them a bit of a hard time for not inviting me. They told me they didn't think anyone would fly over since it wasn't in Colorado, but that I could join if wanted to make the trip. So of course I did! Hannah's family asked if I had ever been glissading and I had not. Why not try new things?

We hiked by Sheep Lake and used ice axes to scootch up to the top of the ridge by Chinook Peak.

Quickly stopped for a summit selfie!

Checked out Rainier... got in some trashbags, and shot off down the hill using ice axes as brakes.

Then made it back just in time for Hannah and Andy's engagement party. :)
