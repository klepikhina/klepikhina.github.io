With Kelsea in town we need to check out some new hikes! I've been wanting to check out Lake Aloha, and what better way to do it than to see it from above off of Pyramid Peak. This hike is a steep slog through the forest until you reach the semi-scramble-y summit.

We met a nice man saying this was the toughest hike he's done. Heck yeah! He also saw a rattlesnake which we kept a weary eye out for on the way down. What is it doing up here!?
