With an injury in the family and a free weekend, we made a weekend trip down to Sequoia. We started on the north side of the park (Big Stump entrance) and checked out the General Grant tree - the nation's Christmas Tree.

We walked through the Fallen Monarch tree.

And learned some fun facts! Most interestingly - the United States is willing to use just about any measurement except the metric system.

While we were on the north side of the park, we drove through the first part of Kings Canyon National Park and stopped by Hume lake where we stumbled upon a beach with a million snail shells.

An aside... the folks carving into rocks and trees should go straight to jail...

The road through the park was closed for the winter/spring and the detour road CA-245 was also closed due to construction. Instead of driving all the way back into Fresno, we took a drive down some CA country roads. I wish I captured some photos but this was a highlight of the trip. With lush green grass, spring flowers, and afternoon sunshine, these single lane country roads glowed. I'll keep those roads a secret for now.

The following day we checked out the south side of the park. We drove through Tunnel Rock which was clearly scuffed up by old RVs and trucks. Then we stopped at the Hospital Rock Pictographs and the Middle Fork Kaweah River.

We'll certainly have to come back and climb both Moro Rock (easy approach) and Castle Rocks (a bit more of a mission).

We walked out to the General Sherman Tree (the largest tree in the world by volume) and the McKinley Tree.

Car for scale.
