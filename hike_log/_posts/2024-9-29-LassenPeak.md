We spent the weekend in the beautiful Trinity Alps with amazing friends - riding ATVs, paddleboarding, drinking milkshakes and playing cornhole. On the way back, we stopped for a quick "stroll" to the top of Lassen Peak. Our friends were skeptical that it would be a quick hike so, naturally, Justin and I had to be as fast and casual as we could.

We speed hiked to the top, and casually jogged down... and beat expectations!
