One of the first places we checked out after our migration down south was Hunter Creek Falls.

Everything felt like quite the shift from our previous northern home. We were no longer in a mountain rainforest and were now in the high desert. It's pretty cool to be able to take a stroll up from the sandy desert landscape up into the dense forests of the Sierra Nevadas.

The trail leads to Hunter Creek Falls! What a treat.
