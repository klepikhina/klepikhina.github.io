title: Mount Fisher, Canadian Rockies, BC | 7.75km, 1380m
---

In typical Ksenia and Justin style - we started Mount Fisher at our standard alpine start time - 11am. The road was a little rough getting in but James had no problem slamming the gas pedal and dragging his bald-tired car to the trail head.

After Trail to Ale we were all a bit tired but thrilled to hike the tallest peak in the Southern Rocky's (2846 m  or 9336 ft).

The hike immediately gets straight to the point. Very vertical, right away.

The trail briefly levels out after a kilometer or two. We found a small lake surrounded by the largest marmots I've ever seen. One even tried to steal Samim's backpack!

The brief reprieve gave us some time to reset before heading up the scree field to the ridge. It started gradually...

... and quickly turned into steep and loose scrambling.

As you scramble, you have a beatiful view of some spires in the background. Allegedly there are some very hard climbs somewhere on them. (feat. Katie and Samim)

We of course brought only the nicest charcuterie up on the hike - cheese sticks and meat sticks.

After a nice 3rd to 4th class scramble to the summit (following the yellow trail markers), we made it to the summit and signed the log.

This was one of the few 4th class sections. (feat. James)

The view of Cranbrook on the way down was very cool.

We stopped at the small lake to have a quick snack and nap after the walk down the spooky section.

And finally, we were rewarded with a view of the Fernie ghost rider as we rolled back into town.
