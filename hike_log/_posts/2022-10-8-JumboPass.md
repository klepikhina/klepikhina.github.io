We intended to do Jumbo Pass and Monica Meadows two weekends prior but were turned around due to an active wildfire. This weekend, the fire was "being held" and though we were warned about rolling debris and fallen trees, we decided it was worth trying to drive up anyway.

Justin brough his chainsaw and did some road maintenance to clear some fallen trees on the way up as the fire burned directly on the forest servive road.

The parking lot was fairly packed and I was surprised at how desensitized people were to a fire burning that could potentially block their exit out. The hike views were worth the risk though.
