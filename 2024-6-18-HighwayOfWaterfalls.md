title: Highway of Waterfalls, OR
---

Per a friend's recommendation, we took a drive down the highway of waterfalls in Oregon (N. Umpqua Hwy). Sure enough, there are numerous waterfalls to check out! We had a long day of driving after biking in Bend, OR, so we only stopped at the quick hikes.

Clearwater Falls seems like a great place to camp! Pro tip - looks like there's a smaller, more secluded, campsite on the south side of the falls.

Watson Falls were my favorite! The spray creates a wonderful place to cool down on a toasty day.

The Toketee Falls parking lot is crazy! Not sure much longer this pipe will hold?

Toketee Falls is definitely a spot I'd like to return to. Looks like a great place to highline and cliff jump (if you like very tall jumps). There's also a very cool cave beach.

Slide Creek Falls is a bit of a hidden gem! This looks like the best swim spot out of the falls we saw. Water was running high in June (a bit dangerous to swim), but a spot that we pinned to return to.

On the drive to Crater Lake, we also stopped by a random surprise waterfall! National Creek Falls also looks like a great secluded camp spot. It also looks like there's lots of dirt biking in the area.
