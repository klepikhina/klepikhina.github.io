		        <p>
		        In 2018, 5.2 new cars were sold per 100 adults in Dublin.
		        Next highest were Cork and Waterford with 3.9 new cars per 100 adults.
		        Leitrim and Longford sold the fewest new cars at just 2.1 new cars per 100 adults.
			In northern counties, the popularity of used imports may be higher leading to the smaller number of new car sales per 100 adults.
		        The adult population of each county was taken from the 2016 census with the ages of 19 and under excluded.
