Our friend (split-boarder) forgot his poles and used his resourcefulness to use some tree branches instead.

We quickly made it up to Lepsoe Cabin! One of the Kootenay's many wonders! The Rossland range has MULTIPLE _free_ day use cabins!!

Justin was so excited to tell us about how good carbon poles were until he pole planted once and immediately snapped it.
