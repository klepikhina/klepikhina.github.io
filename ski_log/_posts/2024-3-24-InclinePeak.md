title: Incline Peak, Mt. Rose Highway, CA

I finally got a chance to go for a little tour with a new friend in Reno! We picked the perfect sleepy, sneaky powder day. We started around 11am, there were plenty of parking spaces, and we had the best window. Some people were finishing up their tours, no one else was heading up at the same time as us, and we skied fresh pow with no one else around!

The start for Incline Peak is just west of the meadow on Mt. Rose highway and up on the north side.

We hit some dramatic and wonderful weather - intermittent snow flurries and blue skies.

The top was a bit wind scoured with cornices on the south side and further north-west ridge.

The pow-slashing turns on the way down and these views were worth it!
