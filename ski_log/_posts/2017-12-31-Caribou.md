Sometimes it's funny to write these little posts in retrospect. When Tai, Zack and I did this little tour on New Years Eve, I had just purchased my touring set up and didn't have  beacon or a shovel or a probe (very essential items). Zack made sure to bring me back up items just in case. Though we were touring in an area with low avalanche risk on a low risk day, it's good to be safe! Thankful for good friends.
