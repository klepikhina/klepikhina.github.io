Justin and I had plans to get out skiing with some friends but plans change and plans changed for the sillier. Justin packed up his ski boards (apparently, these in particular, are not ski blades) and decided that the backcountry is the best place to try them out for the first time.

There is no way to not giggle at the tall man with his little skis snowshoeing up the mountain.

Ski boards, heck yeah! Powder, heck yeah! Ski boards + powder, oh no!

Then he got the hang of it and started playing.
