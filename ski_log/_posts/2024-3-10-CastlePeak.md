It's about time we checked out some touring in the area! One weekend after the storm and approaching spring skiing!

We started up across the highway from Boreal ski area and walked up a road for a while.

We scoped a chute for next time! The goal was to give it a go today but conditions were crusty and wind blasted.

The views from the ridge were worth the climb!

Unfortunately we didn't get any incredible summit views - will have to give it another go some other time!
