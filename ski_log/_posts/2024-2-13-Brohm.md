First time sled skiing! Kelsea did amazing doubling me up to the sledding/ sled skiing zone. Only jumped off the sled one time. Lessons learned - counter steering is counterintuitive, sledding is a full body activity, you have to lean so much more than anticipated, side hills are a challenge.

Will we also buy sleds? Perhaps...

We doubled up the road to Brohm Ridge. It hadn't been groomed and we basically sledded up a pump track for 15 minutes.

 The view of Garibaldi and Atwell - truly awe-inspiring. Can't believe this is just your average view in Squamish.

I tried out Kelsea's sled for a little bit in the flattest, most open zone we could find and it was still so challenging. Justin picked up on it much faster - he's a natural.

And Adam is an expert!!
