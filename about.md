I acknowledge that my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjxFvm3E73M&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">identity</a> impacts every aspect of my life from what I write, to what I photograph, to what I read, to what and how I teach, to my service, to my gaze and my status.

I acknowledge that <a href="https://native-land.ca/" target="_blank">the land that I grew up on </a> is the Traditional Territory of the Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Ute and the land I live on is the Traditional Territory of the Sinixt, First Nation People. Colorado's Front Range and the West Kootenay region of BC are contemporary and traditional sites of trade and gathering for many Indigenous peoples.
