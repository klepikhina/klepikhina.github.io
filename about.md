Hi, Iâ€™m Ksenia Lepikhina. Russia born, Colorado raised. Trained in math and statistics, academically interested in health, social justice, climate science and journalism, extracurricularly excited about running, mountain biking, climbing, downhill skiing and nordic skiing, and inclined to enjoy reading, painting and very casually knitting.

I acknowledge that my identity impacts every aspect of my life from what I write, to what I photograph, to what I read, to what and how I teach, to my service, to my gaze and my status in America.

I acknowledge that the land that I live and work on is the Traditional Territory of the Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Ute. Colorado's Front Range is a contemporary and traditional site of trade and gathering for many Indigenous peoples.
