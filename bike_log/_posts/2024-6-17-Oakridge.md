Big day of pedaling, ahoy! Woke up at a perfect secret camp spot and kicked off the day with some fog and rain at Salt Creek Falls. Then head into town for a coffee at Mane Street Coffee before hitting the trails.

This is a 10/10 shuttle zone and an IMBA gold certified ride area! We pedaled the road twice, but we'll be back to shuttle next time.

First, we did a lap on Lawler trail. The blue-black trail takes you down through gorgeous forests, up a surprise climb, down some exposed switchbacks, and rewards you with a few flowy turns and side hits at the bottom.

The second lap we did was on Eula Ridge. We traversed over on Mt. Hardesty (blue trail with some steep sidehilling). Eula Ridge reminds me of the steep and loose riding in Rossland.

The trails were so fun even the beard lichen couldn't resist a ride!
