title: Thunder Mountain Loop, Kirkwood, CA | 11.7mi, 2480ft
---

Starting at 2pm during a heat wave, even in the mountain, is not the best idea. We did it anyway! Overall, a gorgeous loop.

Castle Rock Trail was tricky to find in places at the start due to a large burn area. Pedaling in soft ash in very hot dry air was not the best, but the views at the top of this section were lovely.

It was so cool to see Kirkwood in the summer and we had a great time identifying what we had ski and what we want to ski.

The climb up to the top of the Sentinels was a bit of a hike a bike.
