Big loop on a trail bike but hugely rewarding! We parked at the Fountain Place Road x Saxon Tie Road intersection and pedaled the Powerline Road to High Meadows Road to Star Lake Road. If there was a way to shuttle this road by getting around the gate, that would make this lap even better. The road is a steep grind and covers about half of the elevation gain.

We then hopped on Star Lake Trail and switchbacked our way up to Star Lake and the Tahoe Rim Trail.

In broad daylight, we watched a bat swoop out of the trees, drink some water from the lake and fly right past us to say hi before dipping back into the forest. Magical experience!

The Tahoe Rim Trail provided gorgeous views of Lake Tahoe as we climbed to the top of Freel Pass.

I would highly recommend this loop just to get to the top of this pass! Gorgeous views all around and a must do downhill to rip to the Armstrong Pass trail.

Armstrong Pass to Corral Trail is one of my favorite trails in the area. Flowy corners with beautiful wildflowers, especially at sunset. There's even a slab! One of the few in the Tahoe area.
