Family ride in CB! Nothing to complain about (but I find a way to complain about the climb anyways). The Teocalli climb is no joke! This time of year, there's a river flowing down parts of the trail. If it looks like you should bushwack around the river - don't. Go through!

The climb continues gradually up a road, and then bam! straight uphill. The trail has become increasingly popular with motos which only makes the climb feel harder. Wish I had a motor.

After over 2000 ft of climbing, you're rewarded with gorgeous summit views.

The descent is a ripper. This was my first time riding this trail on a trail bike, and like most downhills, it's way better with the extra squish.

Wrapped up the day with a paddleboard and swim down the Slate River. Delightful! 10/10.
